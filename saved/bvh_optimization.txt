Settings for all these:
	width: 800
	height: 600
	samples: 16
	bounces: 12

None of these runs were cold runs (meaning all of the runs were
ran at least once before to make sure the OS had time to cache the
application)

Cube:
before:
	real    0m5.111s
	user    0m4.916s
	sys     0m0.030s

after:
	real    0m3.278s
	user    0m3.061s
	sys     0m0.050s

1.56 times faster!

Monkey:
before:
real    4m56.464s (296,464 seconds)
user    4m49.797s
sys     0m0.321s

after:
real    0m11.271s
user    0m5.090s
sys     0m0.246s

a whopping 26.3 times faster!

notable: the most of the time was spent on loading the model
into memory. This is incredibly slow because we do a lot of 
malloc and realloc calls. This only happens on linux so only
linux is slow. Since dosbox is our main priority we focus on
optimizing only for dosbox
