Blender settings:
- 128 samples
- 16 bounces (for all materials)
- 800x600 image size
- cycles 1 cpu

Sphere test:
blender took: 37.96 seconds
our raytracer: 17.199

our raytracer is about 2.2 times faster?? win for us?? No
this is because we use a sphere primitive and blender a sphere
model. If we load the sphere model from blender to our raytracer 
we get: 3 minutes 8.569 seconds!
Wow that is quite a long time. It is interesting to see that
loading the model actually took quite a long time. After timing
it we see that loading the model itself actually takes 1 minute
and 53 seconds. So when we account for that the actual render 
only took 75 seconds. Still slower than blender but at a lot
closer to the 2 times mark we see in other tests.

Monkey test:
blender took: 50.19 seconds
our raytracer: 1 minute 40.782 seconds (100.782 seconds)

blender is about 2 times faster (1.8 if we account for model loading)

final:

These comparisons were not completely fair since blender has already
loaded the models in and our raytracer has to load them in at the beginning
(which is included in the time and takes about 13 seconds). On top of that our renderer ran in WSL2 
so this is not running at maximum speed. But it is still a good metric
to have a basic idea.

Noteable is that blender was very fast at rendering background
that doesn't contain any objects. This is not the case in our
raytracer. This is probably due to some optimizations which
we have not yet made. One that comes to mind would be doing
basic addaptive sampling of 5 points and if none hit, go to the
next pixel.
